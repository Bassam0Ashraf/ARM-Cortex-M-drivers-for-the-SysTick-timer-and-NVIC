# **Project Overview:**
In this project, we will develop drivers for the SysTick timer and the Nested Vectored Interrupt
Controller (NVIC) on the TM4C series microcontrollers specially (TM4C123GH6PM). The project aims to provide hands-on
experience with embedded systems programming, specifically focusing on system timers and
interrupt management. we will configure the system to run at a clock speed of 16MHz.

 # **Objectives:**
### 1. **SysTick Timer Driver:**
- Initialize the SysTick timer.
- Implement functions to start and stop the timer.
- Implement an interrupt handler for SysTick.
- Configure the SysTick timer to generate interrupts at specific time intervals.


### 2. **NVIC Driver:**

- Enable and disable interrupts for specific IRQ numbers.
- Set the priority for specific IRQ numbers.
- Enable and disable specific ARM system or fault exception.
- Set the priority for specific ARM system or fault exception
